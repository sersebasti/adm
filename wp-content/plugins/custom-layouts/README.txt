* Popular posts widget
* Recent posts widget
* A shop layout for listing products (*when combined WooCommerce, Easy Digital Downloads and other product plugins)
* A post grid
* A portfolio grid
* Masonry layouts
* Custom post type layouts
And much more...

== Layout Editor ==

Build single column or grid based layouts using the visual editor.

* Supports Masonry out of the box
* Tons of design options to build the layout you want
* Choose to add numbered Pagination ( 'Load more' and 'Infinite scroll' options are planned )
* Powerful query builder
* Responsive columns (choose how many columns to show for each device size - and set your own breakpoints)

== Query Builder ==

Options include:

* Multiple post type selection
* Tag, category and custom taxonomy restriction
* Single author or multiple author restriction
* Ordering by - post title, published date (for recent posts), modified date, post ID, comment count (for popular posts), author
* Posts per page
* Offset
* Ignore sticky posts

== Template Editor ==

* Design individual templates (cards) using our drag and drop editor - creativity is your only limit
* Link them with your layouts to build beautiful designs
* Hundreds of design options
* Unique blocks for building templates + template editor
  * granular control over the blocks you add to your design - choose from a growing list
  * to re-arrange blocks, just drag and drop
  * each block has it's own sidebar full of options such as spacing, colors (including gradients + alpha transparencies), font settings, borders, and more.
* Currently available blocks: **Post Title**, **Post Type**, **Post Excerpt**, **Post Author**, **Published + Modified Date**, **Custom Field**, **Taxonomies**, **Link**, **Basic Text** (with shortcode support).
[Find out more about our template blocks](https://customlayouts.com/documentation/template-elements/).

== Gutenberg integration ==

* Custom blocks for building layouts
* Seamlessly integrates with our Template Editor
* UI built using 90% Gutenberg components 👍
* Experimental FSE Query block support (drop our Post Template block into the Query block...)
* Works with the version of Gutenberg shipped in WP core, and the Gutenberg plugin (using the latest stable build)

== Built for speed ==

* At its base - loads only 1 css file and 1 javascript file on the frontend - total bundle size approx 15kb.
* CSS file dynamically created, saving resources and requests per page load (+ avoiding inline CSS)
* Caches posts + queries for optimum performance
* Not jQuery dependant

== Includes 7 sample templates ==
We've included a pack of templates ready for you to customise - check the installation tab for how to import these to your site.

== Multilingual ready ==
Custom Layouts should support most multilingual plugins - we use a custom post type to store content that is not stored in the block editor.
* We've also added specific support for WPML's Advanced Translation Editor.

4. Activate the plugin in the Plugin dashboard

= Importing the sample templates =

To import the sample template data, follow these steps:

1. Log in to your site as an administrator.
2. Go to Tools: "Import" in the WordPress admin panel.
3. Install the "WordPress" importer from the list.
4. Activate & Run Importer.
5. Upload the file from our plugin folder - `custom-layouts/sample-data/sample-templates.xml` - using the form provided on that page.
6. You will first be asked to map the authors in this export file to users on the site. For each author, you may choose to map to an existing user on the site or to create a new user.
7. WordPress will then import each of the templates into your site.
8. Access your new templates via wp-admin -> "Custom Layouts" -> "Templates"


== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I add a layout to a page?  (Block editor way) =

Then you can use the `Custom Layouts` block.

All of the layout options are available from within the block inspector, or you can load a saved layout.

= How do I add a layout to a page? (Shortcode method) =

You can find this shortcode in the sidebar of your Layout admin page. 

It will look something like: `[custom-layouts id="123"]`

Where `123` is the ID of your layout

= How do I add a template to a layout? =

* First create a template by heading to "Templates" in the "Custom Layouts" admin menu or by clicking "add new" in the layout block.
* Edit your template and when finished you can choose it from  the "Post Template" dropdown in your layout.


== Known Issues ==

* Admin Template Editor only works on desktop computers (tablets + mobiles not supported)
* Admin Template Editor does not work on IE, all other major browsers supported - ** the frontend of this plugin supports IE 11+, no sweat


== Roadmap ==

* Improve performance and load speed by providing an option to use CSS Grid for layouts + masonry
* Support more CSS unit types in more places
* Blocks for WooCommerce
* Blocks for ACF
* More template blocks (possibly use the block library)
* Additional hover options
* Additional font options - either Google fonts or the Gutenberg api which looks like it's coming soon
* Social/sharing blocks
